This is a trivial threaded socket server.  It listens on port 3137, and anyone who connects
to it gets the message "hello, client!", followed by a disconnect.

You can shut the server down with ctrl-c.


Architecturally, the things that really need to change are:

* A set of real thread libraries.  These days, you shouldn't have to shlep around your 
  own thread pools and dispatch code.

* Either a read timeout on the listening socket, or use select().

* More careful signal handling.

* Connection limits.

* A worker class that actually does something.

* The worker should probably be descended from super-class or an interface.
